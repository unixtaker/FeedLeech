FeedLeech is a simple ruby project to learn ruby development and help make
my life easier by having some scripts to store a local copy of some podcast 
websites that I like.

I want to be able to stream the videos to my TV in chronilogical order so a 
simple webmirror just won't do.

If anybody wants to use the code, feel free and I'll be happy to see any
incorporate any pull requests.
